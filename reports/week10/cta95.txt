Individual status report week 10

LAST WEEK'S GOALS
	- Proposal and deliverables
	- Filtering feature
	- Bug fixes

PROGRESS
Since the last report, I've assisted my team with revising our proposal and schedule.
I also wrapped up the filtering feature that David started. This includes being able
to filter issues by status, labels, assignees, etc. I also made some UI changes for
the list of issues. This week, I'll be helping my team with any front end implementation
that's needed and assist with the final report.

GOALS
	- Help with final report
	- Help with remaining issues and unfinished features
	- Help with bug fixes and UI changes
