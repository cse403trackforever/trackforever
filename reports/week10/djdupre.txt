# Last Week's Goals
- Add mutability of issues
- Refactor the import module into one submodule per supported issue tracker
- Contribute to final report's lessons learned

# Progress
I finally added the editability of issues and projects. There are still some
issues with the server-client interface, but now the web app is at least as
powerful as TaskWarrior for our purposes.
  I did refactor the import module. I also refactored parts of the
authentication module and added auth guards so only signed-in users can access
most of the website.
  I also re-evaluated an imported Google Code project for the final report
draft and fixed some parts of the importer that were graded poorly during the
evaluation.

# Next Week's Goals
- Fix bugs that are weakening the evaluation, specifically GitHub API rate
  limiting
- Update the report to include more recent work
- Create a contributing guide with emphasis on importing from other issue
  trackers
