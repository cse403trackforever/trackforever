Status Report Week 10
2018-05-28

LAST WEEK'S GOALS:
	- Revise all written assignments, including final(?) revision of metrics
	- Assist Will and Chris with implementation of backend server

PROGRESS:
	We revised the proposal again, but evidently much more revision is required. The team, myself included, did not
	quite grasp the depth of changes that had to be made for the final draft. I'll be going through the proposal again
	to further revise it, making much more drastic changes. If time permits, I'll be able to get a revision to the TA
	before the next draft is due.

	Presentation are also coming up soon. It'll be Chris and someone else presenting, but I will be assist with preparing
	the final slides and helping Chris rehearse, so that he can focus on other things.
	
NEXT WEEK'S GOALS
	- Do as much work as possible on report and presentation slides to make sure others have time to do other work
