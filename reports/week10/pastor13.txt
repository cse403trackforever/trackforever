8th Week of Individual Status Reports


I look forward to setting up a server that is capable of responding to the web app, even if it is just a mock response this week. That 
way, we can provide the web app some data to play around with.

This week, I helped getting our final report done. I worked with the team to determine stricter grading guidelines when looking at issues
imported by our issue tracker. Also, I updated the script that automatically generates the report to accomodate for the changes made in
the table. Furthermore, we've decided to add the little user information we get from Google Code when importing, which allows us to make
a generalized rubric for all issue trackers, since it added some unnecessary confusion. Meanwhile, I was working on the server and set up
the backbone for the server. As of now, I am writing tests for the server and also attempting to fix the a bug when we try to store some
projects on the server.

Until next week, I need to focus on finishing up the server and continue working on the evaluation of our project, as it was lacking this
week. I will also look to begin preparing for the final presentation that we have on finals week.
