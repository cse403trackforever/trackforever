Goals
- Automate tests for other metrics (speed, browser support, etc.) 
- Implement the REST API, including sync feature for collaboration via the new server2 project for the backend
- Make issues and projects mutable
- Continue testing, polishing, bug fixing
- Rerun test suite, identify remaining bugs, add any additional tests
- Draft final report

Progress

For this week, many advancements in our project were made. On the server side of things, we refactored some of the types used in the models used (e.g. 
Arrays to Lists) and added responses to requests that did not completely fail (e.g. a request for a list of issues  where only some were found). We also 
ran into the cross-origins issue again when dealing with our server, so we had to implement a fix for that as well. Then, we changed the way we 
interpreted the request to a generic JSON string on the server end to give us greater control of parsing the received information. The server is now 
capable of providing responses to requests made by the web app. As of now, we are working on improving the communication portion between the client and 
server. On the web app half of the project, we fixed some issues, which includes fixing Google Code dates, GitHub importing only open issues, and 
Redmine import issues. We also made strides to making issues and projects editable. More filtering options were added to allow the user to narrow down 
issues. Data for each user is now stored separately. Due to poorer metrics when evaluating Google Code, we decided to roll back some of the changes made 
to the way we interpret Google Code projects. Currently, we are working on getting GitHub OAuth to work, which will enable us to overcome the GitHub 
rate limiting issue that we are experiencing. In addition, we are now using Lighthouse by Google to evaluate the quality of our web app. The reports 
from Lighthouse are also allowing us to find and fix various visual and functional flaws in the webapp.
