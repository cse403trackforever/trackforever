Track Forever - Individual Status Report (Week 3)

LAST WEEK'S GOALS
	N/A

PROGRESS
	During week two, we established our team members and initial project idea. Our group name is “Track Forever”. Our project aims to future-proof issue trackers. We’ve set up most of the tools needed for our work this quarter, including:

	- Messenger group chat for communication
	- Github repository
	- Shared Google drive for documents
	- CSE mailing list (CSE support pending) 

	We’ve also established our team’s weekly availability for group meetings. At the bare minimum, we plan to meet Tuesday and Thursday mornings.

	Beyond tools and scheduling, we’ve also discussed which tools and frameworks we want to utilize to build our project and the resultant functionality we hope to achieve using them.  

NEXT WEEK'S GOALS
	As a team, our goals for the next week are:
	- Conduct more research about the problem
	- Solidify end goal for what we want the project to achieve in terms of features and functionality
	- Decide on a platform for the client and the server
	- Flesh out initial project proposal, rewrite as necessary, add more defined mockups
