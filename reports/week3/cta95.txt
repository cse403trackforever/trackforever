Track Forever - Individual Status Report (Week 3)

LAST WEEK'S GOALS
	N/A

PROGRESS
Since the last week, I've worked with my team members to complete our second project proposal.
I volunteered to take on a PM role to help keep our team stay organized and on track with our schedule.
I created a simple scrum board on our Google drive as a spreadsheet. We took our week three schedule
and turned them into tasks and assigned them accordingly. My teammates and I are going to try to
use it for this week and see if it's useful for our team progress or not. (The board is in our Shared
Google drive, if the staff would like to give us any feedback on it or tips in general about planning, 
it'd be much appreciated)
 
GOALS
This week, my individual tasks / goals are
	- Design the UI for our web app
	- Lead the team status report and turn it in
	- Prepare our weekly schedule for the next week
	- Work with my teammates to create an agenda for Thursday's TA meeting
	- Work with my teammates to design the backend architecture of our project
	- Help with this week's deliverable (project 3)
