# Last Week's Goals
N/A

# Progress
In the first half of the last week I worked on bringing new team members up to
speed and writing the second proposal. I addressed feedback from the original
proposal by recognizing the problem of merging the content of different issue
trackers. I also researched the popularity of different issue trackers to begin
to decide which ones to pursue and what elements we should include in our file
format. I learned from the new proposal feedback that this research should be
more concretely represented.
  After the proposal, I expanded on some early work by Christopher to parse the
Google Code Archive JSON API. I am learning Kotlin and finding the JSON parsing
easy to implement. However, there are some problems with Google Code's schema,
in particular an inconsistency between documentation and reality.

# Next Week's Goals
- Participate in deciding a file format using knowledge of Google Code's schema
- Help decide on the backend system architecture
- Prototype code to convert Google Code's issues to our decided upon format
- Write unit tests for Google Code issue parsing
