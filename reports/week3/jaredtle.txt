Status Report Week 3

LAST WEEK'S GOALS:
	N/A

PROGRESS:
	After week 2's meetings, I began familiarizing myself with Kotlin, which has been 
	established as our language of choice for manipulating text when importing and 
	exporting issues. In addition, I spent time over the weekend researching Redmine,
	another common issue tracker than we can likely add support for fairly rapidly. I
	worked with William to help build out the comparison between the various issue trackers,
	and I've been discussing how best to store the data with him. However, I would like to 
	finalize this design over the next week in a larger group meeting.

NEXT WEEK'S GOALS:
	- Design the format we'll be using to store issues
	- Begin skeleton-ing the backend that will interface between the various issue converters
	- Meet with team members who are beginning to write converters, find out what they need from
		the backend, and what they can provide.
