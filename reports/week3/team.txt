Track Forever - Team Status Report (Week 3)

Last week’s goals
	As a team,
	- Conduct more research about the problem
	- Solidify end goal for what we want the project to achieve in terms of features and functionality
	- Decide on a platform for the client and the server
	- Flesh out initial project proposal, rewrite as necessary, add more defined mockups

Progress
	This week, we’ve began revising our project proposal based on staff feedback and the next proj3 assignment spec. 
	David and Chris have looked into the format and retrieval of Google Code and GitHub issues. As part of this 
	investigation, the two have produced code which parses issues from both sources when given the project name. 
	With the help of WIlliam, they added test hooks to allow for testing data to be used in the test suite for these parsers. 
	Chris spent Wednesday splitting the repository in two with the parsing code being placed in a separate repository and 
	linked to the main one via git submodules. This change allows us to require code reviews before any changes are made. 
	As a team, we’ve white boarded the system architecture and we’re working on the unified  format of our issue tracker. 
	By Thursday night, we will have an architecture and implementation plan (proj3), which will include the web app UI 
	design and architecture diagrams.

Week 4 goals
	During week 4, we plan to begin implementation. This includes -

	Create the conversion tool for two bug trackers to our own format
	Implement the UI of the web app using dummy bug entries
	Research tools to allow offline support for our web app (i.e. a service worker)

	We haven’t finished breaking down and delegating tasks for the next week, but it will be on our shared scrum board by the end of the week.
