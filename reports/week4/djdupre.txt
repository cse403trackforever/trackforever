# Last Week's Goals
- Participate in deciding a file format using knowledge of Google Code's schema
- Help decide on the backend system architecture
- Prototype code to convert Google Code's issues to our decided upon format
- Write unit tests for Google Code issue parsing

# Progress
In the last week I did help decide on the file format and committed the Kotlin
representation of that format to the repository (pull request here:
https://github.com/cse403trackforever/server/pull/2/files).
  I did help decide on the backend system architecture which is now diagrammed
in the last project proposal. I also researched offline database technologies
and decided to use IndexedDB.
  I did not accomplish my goals related to Google Code because those tasks were
handed off to William and Christopher. I instead set up the front-end framework
of Track Forever using Angular and bootstrap css. The code has not yet been
reviewed but it includes a service to eventually pull mock issues from local
files and eventually from our RESTful API.
  I cannot make much more progress on the front-end until the team agrees on
the interface between the web app and the server, which we will decide
tomorrow.

# Next Week's Goals
- Help design the API contracts between web app and backend
- Identify what Angular components are required to implement our design based
  on the UI mockup
- Implement Angular services to consume our API and inject it with mock data
