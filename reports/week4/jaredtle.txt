Status Report Week 4
2018-04-16

LAST WEEK'S GOALS:
	- Design the format we'll be using to store issues
	- Begin skeleton-ing the backend that will interface between the various issue converters
	- Meet with team members who are beginning to write converters, find out what they need from
		the backend, and what they can provide.



PROGRESS:
	We were able to begin implementing our chosen format for storing issues in our issue tracker. I've mostly
	been learning from Chris, as he is the one most experienced with Kotlin and our particular backend setup.
	While I did meet with the team a bit, I was unfortunately unable to perform much work over the weekend
	due to family commitments.
	
	We were, however, able to get the basic outline for our plugins in line. I plan to finish the redmine
	plugin implementation I was doing as practice in Kotlin, along with any other tasks assigned to me this
	week by the team.

NEXT WEEK'S GOALS:
	- Meet with team to figure out how we'll be storing this issues (database, if so what kind, etc.)
	- Finish initial issue tracker plugins, start thinking and discussing ways to test them.
	- Potentially work with Chris on writing API, user guide
