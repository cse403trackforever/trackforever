Track Forever - Team Status Report (Week 4)

Last week’s goals

	During week 4, we plan to begin implementation. This includes -

	- Create the conversion tool for two bug trackers to our own format
	- Implement the UI of the web app using dummy bug entries
	- Research tools to allow offline support for our web app (i.e. a service worker)


Progress
	During week 4, we’ve begun shifting from designing to implementation. For the backend, 
	two plugins were completed (Google Code and GitHub) and work was made towards persisting 
	the results via MongoDB - a structural database management system. Work was also done 
	towards providing a test suite for the Google Code plugin with offline JSON files from 
	projects pulled from the Google Code archives. For the web app, we’ve defined the sitemap 
	and the UI design. We’ve also designed the API that our web app will call. We mocked this 
	API for the front-end but only one component has been implemented so far, with more coming 
	by the end of this week. As far as assignments, we’ve done our project presentation slides 
	and we’re working on completing the user manual. Also, we’ve spent time revising the metrics 
	section of the project proposal so we now have a more concrete way of measuring the project’s success.

Week 5 goals
	- Finish a conversion tool for at least one more bug tracker
	- Complete the addition of data persistence on the backend 
	- Implement the REST API for interfacing between the webapp and back end
	- Implement offline support in web app such that the page remains even after refresh
