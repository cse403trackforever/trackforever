# Last Week's Goals
- Help design the API contracts between web app and backend
- Identify what Angular components are required to implement our design based
  on the UI mockup
- Implement Angular services to consume our API and inject it with mock data

# Progress
Christine and I created the initial design for the API here:
https://github.com/cse403trackforever/trackforever/wiki/RESTful-API-Specification
We decided to postpone the authentication aspect of the API and focus on the
core functionality. The API is also missing some features which we decided to
add in the last week (e.g. synchronization).
  I added some high-level Angular components and routing to give the web app
some structure so we can start working on the separate pages in parallel. One
difficulty I had was deciding on the folder structure for the project as there
are many different correct ways to do it in Angular.
  I did implement an Angular service to take our initial API and use mock data.
After our decision to move issue tracker conversions to the web app, I also
created an import module to help make that transition.

# Next Week's Goals
- Set up continuous integration for the front-end
- Update and add unit tests to existing components and services
- Implement the offline database
