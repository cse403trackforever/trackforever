Status Report Week 5
2018-04-23

LAST WEEK'S GOALS:
	- Meet with team to figure out how we'll be storing this issues (database, if so what kind, etc.)
	- Finish initial issue tracker plugins, start thinking and discussing ways to test them.
	- Potentially work with Chris on writing API, user guide

PROGRESS:
	Following a major pivot on the scope and design of our project, our priorities need readjustment.
	I spent a good portion of my time last week working on the user manual, ensuring that our design
	was settled. Fortunately, Christine was able to assist with the diagramming.
	
	Much of our previous work, however, will need to be redone in JavaScript (specifically TypeScript), so
	that has been the team focus for a while now. I have been reading through tutorials and guides in order
	to get my own skills up to speed for this task.

NEXT WEEK'S GOALS:
	- Make sure user manual is continually updated to reflect the current processes
	- Assist with porting older conversion code to javascript
	- Begin working on server code, which up until now has been conceptual at best
