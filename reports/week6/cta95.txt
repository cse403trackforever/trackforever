Individual status report week 6

LAST WEEK'S GOALS
	- Web app implementation
	- Add authentication feature
	- Help with deliverables

PROGRESS
Since the last status report, I've been helping my team with assignments and the
implementation of the web app. I've used bootstrap to style the pages into a 
consistent design. I've added authentication using Firebase. Currently, I've only
got Facebook auth configured, but will be doing Github and email as well. 

GOALS
	- Add email and Github authentication
	- Ensure all pages get redirected as needed if unauthenticated
	- Continue refining the web UI
	- Help with team deliverables
