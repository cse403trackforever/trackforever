# Last Week's Goals
- Set up continuous integration for the front-end
- Update and add unit tests to existing components and services
- Implement the offline database

# Progress
Last week I set up continuous integration for the front-end. After the
assignment was due I also added deployment to our CI so our current build of
master can be demoed here: https://cse403trackforever.github.io/webapp/
  After setting up CI, I updated our unit tests from the auto-generated ones
to minimal passing test suites. This opened the path for others to add unit
tests.
  I added an offline database using localForage and IndexedDB. This led to some
major modularization of our import module, which should make it easier to add
support for more issue trackers.

# Next Week's Goals
- Update the web app to switch between online/offline modes
- Update the architecture plan to include CORS proxy
- Rewrite the report's competitors section in response to feedback
