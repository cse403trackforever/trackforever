Status Report Week 5
2018-04-30

LAST WEEK'S GOALS:
	- Make sure user manual is continually updated to reflect the current processes
	- Assist with porting older conversion code to javascript
	- Begin working on server code, which up until now has been conceptual at best

PROGRESS:
	I was out for part of the week due to illness and midterms, but was able to catch up on progress with my team.
	We discovered an issue with accessing certain APIs using JavaScript, but DJ and the others appear
	to have found a solution. I will do what I can to assist.

NEXT WEEK'S GOALS:
	- Test and implement CORS solution.
	- Revise the user manual and project proposal (again)
	- Assist with implementing the offline server module. Will likely defer to William and Chris
