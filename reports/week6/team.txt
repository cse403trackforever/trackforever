Progress

This week we continue with implementation. The UI and pages have been revised by Christine to have a welcome page and sign in page component to
accommodate for user authentication. Authentication works for Facebook and we will also be adding Github and email. 
Chris refined the UI to ensure a clean experience across all device sizes. William added a third plugin for importing issues from Redmine and 
Chris found a work-around to mitigate the CORS issue we encountered this week. Meanwhile, David has made significant work towards making our website
a true PWA with offline support and dynamic online/offline switching. Jared continued work refining our project proposal, filling in a number of
missing areas, clarifying the explicit details as to how our product goes above and beyond our competitors, and enhancing the clarity of our
motivation, architecture, and metrics sections.
