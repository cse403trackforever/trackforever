# Generating a project report

Due to the nature of this project, generating a report requires manual evaluation of performance. However, creation of the final formatted PDF, and all associated figures, is automated as much as possible.

In order to generate results, projects must first be imported into Track Forever. The imported issues must then be compared against the original issues, to look for any missing information, improper rendering, or other issues that may arise. For each compared issue, a rubric is filled out and then added to a comma-seperated-value file (CSV). Finally, the automated script tabulates the results and generates a report.
