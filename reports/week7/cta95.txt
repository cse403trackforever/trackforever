Individual status report week 7

LAST WEEK'S GOALS
	- Add email and Github authentication
	- Ensure all pages get redirected as needed if unauthenticated
	- Continue refining the web UI
	- Help with team deliverables

PROGRESS
Since the last report, I've assisted my team with revising our proposal and user manual.
I've added Github authentication. I still need to configure email and all of the other
smaller features needed (i.e. separate sign up and sign in / such as forgetting password). 
I've added code to ensure users aren't able to access pages when they aren't signed in.
I've also added a new landing / welcome page for when the user first acccesses our page
without being signed in. I hope to add more information about our project and website to it.

GOALS
	- Email authentication
	- Unit tests
	- Help with team deliverables
	- Help with front end implementation as needed
