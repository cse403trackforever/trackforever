# Last Week's Goals
- Update the web app to switch between online/offline modes
- Update the architecture plan to include CORS proxy
- Rewrite the report's competitors section in response to feedback

# Progress
I updated the web app to switch between online and offline modes based on the
browser's onLine status and http errors. I also tried to make the app run
entirely offline (cached) using service workers, but I'm running into trouble
once it's deployed to GitHub Pages.
  I did not update the architecture plan to include a CORS proxy because this
part of our architecture is much simpler than I thought it would be.
  I did go into some more detail about competitors, but not quite enough.
  Most of my efforts with week actually went into writing unit tests. I wrote
all the tests for the issue fetching services and most of the import service
tests.

# Next Week's Goals
- Evaluate the conversion quality from one of the supported issue trackers
- Add exporting to JSON
- Add mutability of issues
