Status Report Week 7
2018-05-07

LAST WEEK'S GOALS:
	- Test and implement CORS solution.
	- Revise the user manual and project proposal (again)
	- Assist with implementing the offline server module. Will likely defer to William and Chris

PROGRESS:
	We made significant changes to the project proposal, in grammer, message, and layout. Unfortunately, more 
	have to be made based on the feedback we recieved. In addition, with another project coming up that will require
	significant writing, which I will likely be doing a lot of. The project assignment for this is somewhat vague, so
	I'll attempt to get some clarification before Thursday.
	
	Backend progress was pushed back to this week, due to unplanned work that had to be done on the version control.
	The backend will be in Java most likely, so I'll be able to help more here.
	
NEXT WEEK'S GOALS
	- Revise the user manual and project proposal (again)
	- Figure out how on Earth we're going to measure and document project results
	- Assist with implementing the offline server module. Will likely defer to William and Chris
