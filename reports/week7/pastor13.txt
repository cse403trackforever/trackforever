5th Week of Individual Status Reports

As for next week, there are many goals that I should work on. I need to help with testing our current plugins and work on ironing out the details of 
the API between the server and web app. Also, I should focus on implementing offline support for the web app, as this is a crucial part of the project.
Another big goal for next week is how we deal with the cross origins problem with Google Code and Redmine. If this all gets done, I will try and see if 
I can help out my teammates working with the front end.

We agreed to solve the cross origins problem by editing the URL to go through another server to handle the header. I helped edit bits of the user manual and the project proposal this week, specifically, the last portion of the motivation section and revised the schedule. Afterwards, I have been
working on getting the offline portion of our project working. I am still trying to work with MongoDB and understanding the way it works and how I can
interact with the GET, PUT, and POST requests that will be sent from our web app to the server. I think the most difficult portion of this is trying to
use my previous knowledge of MySQL and use it with MongoDB. Obviously the commands to do the same thing are different, so that just takes time getting
used to it.

I want to finish implementing the offline portion of the server, so that is the primary goal of this week. Also, since we need to get the results in
this Thursday, I plan to help out with the result generation process, which may include automating (and figuring out how to automate) as much as 
possible.
