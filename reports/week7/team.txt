Track Forever - Team Status Report (Week 7)

Goals
- Configuration page component
- Build framework to allow for collaborative online and offline functionality
- Enhance the existing test suite to boost code coverage
- Implement offline support in web app such that the page remains even after refresh
- Add Github and email support for authentication feature
- Write tests to cover import functions
- Revise user manual to match current UI functions
- Revise project proposal to address given feedback

Progress

This week we made many changes to our motivation portion of the project proposal to address the feedback from Michael regarding the use cases. During 
this week, we also enhanced our test suite by adding more tests that cover the plugins used for importing. In addition, we have also added an export 
to json function. Coveralls were added to the GitHub repository, which helps us maintain steady code coverage as we add more to our project. 
Further optimizations to the source code were made, including removal of some redundant models and refactoring of some data types. GitHub
authentication has been added to the project (still testing). As of now, we are currently in the process of testing the implementation of hashes. 
Also, we are working on gathering projects to use with our project for the preliminary results.
