Track Forever - Individual Status Report (Week 6)

LAST WEEK'S GOALS
    Add tests for the revision system
    Cleanup the revision PR and get it merged into the master branch
    Begin work on a merge ui for revisions
    Ensure team remains consistent and on track
    Help backend implement the API

PROGRESS
    A lot of this week was spent enhancing and improving our project proposal and writing our initial results for the project.
    I split out and merged three of four PRs of the revision system which took a significant amount of time to bring to a merge-able state due to the large structural changes in places and breaking the Typescript type system via a misplaced parentheses. The final PR requires more tests to boost coverage before it can be merged.
    William and I have planned our approach and tools for the rewrite of the backend and server.

GOALS
    Finish tests for the revision system then merge final PR
    Begin work on a merge ui for revisions
    Fix mobile ui for the fontend
    Ensure team remains consistent and on track
    Help backend implement the API
