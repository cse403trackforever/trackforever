# Last Week's Goals
- Evaluate the conversion quality from one of the supported issue trackers
- Add exporting to JSON
- Add mutability of issues

# Progress
I evaluated the conversion quality of the 'appscale' project from Google Code.
I noticed many problems with the import process. For example, only one page of
the Google Code project was being imported out of three. I fixed this error and
some other bugs this week.
  I did also add the export to JSON feature.
  I did not add mutability yet because I was busy fixing bugs. The issues with
GitHub Pages (our choice for deployment) have kept me especially busy. I'm
considering switching our website hosting to another service.

# Next Week's Goals
- Add mutability of issues
- Fix issues with deployment
- Help create presentation slides
