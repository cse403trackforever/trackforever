Status Report Week 8
2018-05-14

LAST WEEK'S GOALS:
	- Revise the user manual and project proposal (again)
	- Figure out how on Earth we're going to measure and document project results
	- Assist with implementing the offline server module. Will likely defer to William and Chris

PROGRESS:
	Both the proposal and the initial results took a lot of work. However, we were able to make significant
  revisions to the proposal, as well as create a process for documenting initial results. I did not have
  as much time as I would've liked to further document the results, so I will be making quite a few more
  changes to the report over the coming weeks.
  
  For the first part of the this week, I'm going to be focusing on the presentation I need to give. Will
  and I need to redo the slides, considering how much has changed since the first presentation. In addition,
  we still need to figure out how to do the backend issue tracker. I hope to sit down with the others to
  figure out what we're going to do.
  
  Oh, and we need to do a code review on another project. That will take up a large amount of meeting time.
	
NEXT WEEK'S GOALS
	- Revise all written assignments (again), and improve the automated reports
	- Sit down with team and hammer out code review of another project
	- Finish presentation slides
  - Backend...stuff
