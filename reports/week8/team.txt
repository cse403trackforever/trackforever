Track Forever - Team Status Report (Week 8)

Goals
- List plans and goals as bullets, who’s responsible, rollover any tasks from last week that didn’t get completed
- Add additional UI features such as a user settings page
- Add email support for authentication feature
- Implement the REST API for interfacing between the webapp and back end
- Implement issue syncing and merging between frontend and backend  
- Perform and record manual tests for issue conversion quality
- Automate tests for other metrics (speed, browser support, etc.) 

Progress
We have finished adding email support for authentication. We also added a user settings page. As for the tests and 
results, we’ve finished writing a python script that will automatically generate a LateX file containing the report. 
As of now, the script only works for the most important metric, which is the conversion quality for each issue tracker. 
During this week, we’ve also discovered some issues with rate limiting, specifically from GitHub. Unauthenticated users 
are only allowed 60 requests per hour and authenticated users are allowed 5000. This is a problem if a user wanted to 
import a very large project with over 5000 issues. We’ve also been fixing issues with importing issues from servers 
correctly. For instance, Google Code was only importing a page of issues (up to 100 issues). Also, we realized that 
GitHub was only importing open issues. Furthermore, we are trying to deal with problems importing from Redmine. We’re 
currently in the process of migrating from Angular 5 to Angular 6, which might prove to be difficult since we have some 
dependencies that rely on Angular 5. Hashing and Firebase hosting have also been added. A simple search and label filter 
has been implemented in the web app as well.


Week 8 goals
- Automate tests for other metrics (speed, browser support, etc.) 
- Clean up and create a consistent theme for the webapp
- Implement the REST API, including sync feature
- Make issues and projects mutable
- Continue testing, polishing, and bug fixing
