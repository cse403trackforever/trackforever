PROGRESS
Since the last report, I've assisted my team with revising our proposal, schedule,
and preparing for our presentation. I've been out sick a majority of last week
unfortunately, so I didn't get to do as much as I wanted to. Feeling a lot better
and am hoping for a more productive upcoming week. 

GOALS
	- Proposal and deliverables
	- Address code review and open issues
	- Help with implementing remaining unfinished features
