Status Report Week 8
2018-05-14

LAST WEEK'S GOALS:
	- Revise all written assignments (again), and improve the automated reports
	- Sit down with team and hammer out code review of another project
	- Finish presentation slides
 	- Backend...stuff

PROGRESS:
	We revised the proposal again, and based on feedback it seems to only require a few minor revisions as
	of now, aside from the additional work that must be done for the coming weeks. We also need to reevaluate
	some of the metrics, but that can wait until the project is closer to completion.

	The presentation also went fairly well, and in the process the team had some nice discussion on what the features
	are that we exactly plan to finish and what we plan to emphasize for our final project.
	
	In the coming week, we plan to do as much as possible on the backend server infrastructure. Hopefully I'll be able to
	contribute more in this area.
	
NEXT WEEK'S GOALS
	- Revise all written assignments, including final(?) revision of metrics
	- Assist Will and Chris with implementation of backend server
