Track Forever - Team Status Report (Week 9)

Goals
- Automate tests for other metrics (speed, browser support, etc.) 
- Clean up and create a consistent theme for the webapp
- Implement the REST API, including sync feature
- Make issues and projects mutable
- Continue testing, polishing, and bug fixing
- Consider working on optimizations

Progress
This week, we have been working on addressing the feedback we have received from the other team. This included refactoring some code 
such as changing some types, making fields optional, and reorganizing the structure of a package. Something that we accomplished that 
we started from last week was our migration from Angular 5 to Angular 6. One of the driving forces behind this migration was a bug 
related to Service Workers in Angular 5. Another thing is currently a work in progress is making issues and projects mutable. We have 
also been working on the offline portion of the project. As of now, we have a prototype of the server that contains functions used to 
interact with the data being sent from the web app. In addition to starting the server code, we have also added continuous integration 
and coveralls to the server repository as well. Unfortunately because of how maps are dealt with when converting to JSON, we are trying 
to figure out a good way to encode/decode to JSON between the web app and server.
